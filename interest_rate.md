## Where do Derivatives fall into the field of Quantitative Finance

Investments are key! 

What is investing? 

The process taking an ownership position in an asset with the goal of receiving 
 a positiohn in an asset by appreciation of the assets value

Nomenclature: 
Assets: Collection of all assets for investment 

Products: Huge uiverse of assets are divided into two classes. 
1. Cash Products---> Elemental assets, stocks, bonds currencies and commodities 
2. Derivatives ---> Forwards, futures, swaps and options. THis is what I am focusing on 

Distinction between the two is Cash product, is a stand alone product

A derivative is an asset link or derived from another asset. Called underlying asset

THe structure and value of the derivative asset is defined by its relationship to the underlying derivative

Two distinct notions of Value: 
1. Price. Determied on markets
1. Fair Value. THis corresponds to the correct value --> Cash flow analysis...arbitrage 

Arbitrage: Super important concept here

Arbitrage is defined as the relative valuation method and is the ideal tool for 
determining the relationship between the value of a derivative asset and its underlying



Derivatives Structure are as follows: 

Forwards and futures are contracts that lock in the price of two parties that will buy and sell an asset for at some future date. THe traded asset is the underlying

Options are similiar to forwards but one party has the right to not participate at the time of the contract expires.


Swaps are linked to interest rates. Swaps allow a floating interest rate to be switched to a fixed rate. 


Risk Management. You lose money. Take the L. Derivatives exists as risk management tool!
